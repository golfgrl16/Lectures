# MATH 2341 Lectures Notes

In this repo I will post the lecture notes for each class day. I plan for the
majority of these to be jupyter notebooks, however they may be some handwritten notes
for some topics.

These lecture notes are to supplement your understanding. It is vital that you come to class prepared
each day. You cannot just read the lecture notes and expect to do well in the course!
